hi! we're a couple of UWaterloo students that were fed up with tech job boards for internships (especially WaterlooWorks!)
we're making a better job board to make job matching easier for both students and employers

the current process:
- apply for every job you remotely qualify for
- employers receive hundreds of applications, most of which are fluff
- employers use ATS, leading to many qualified candidates getting ignored
- you receive a rejection for a job that you would've been the ideal candidate for

we're building a job board to overcome that!
- on our job board, you don't find the jobs; they find you!
- you only receive invitations to apply for jobs which you have the skills for
- employers only receive applications from those who are qualified
- no more need for ATS, meaning your resume has a higher chance of being seen by a human
- you land jobs you are meant for; employers find employees they actually want
